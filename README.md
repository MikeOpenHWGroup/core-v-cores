# CORE-V Family of Open-Source RISC-V Cores

CORE-V is a family of permissively licensed, open-source RISC-V cores curated by the OpenHW Group ecosystem. Below is the CORE-V Roadmap of Application class and Embedded class cores followed by a short description of each of the cores and links to their respective GitHub repositories.  The overall CORE-V Roadmap as well as core specific features and functionality are driven by [members of the OpenHW Group](https://www.openhwgroup.org/#members-partners). Details regarding [OpenHW Group membership can be found here.](https://www.openhwgroup.org/membership/#tab-membership). The full [OpenHW Project Dashboard](https://github.com/openhwgroup/programs/blob/master/dashboard/Dashboard_SpreadSheetFriendly.md) provides more details about OpenHW projects.

# CORE-V CVA6 Family, 6-Stage Cores configurable as Embedded or Application Class

[CVA6](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6), originally known as the PULP Ariane core, is a family of 6-stage, single issue, in-order cores implementing RV32GC or RV64GC extensions with three privilege levels M, S, U to fully support a Unix-like (Linux, BSD, etc.) operating system. CVA6 has configurable size, separate TLBs, a hardware PTW and branch-prediction (branch target buffer, branch history table and a return address stack).

- [CV32A60AX](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6) CV32A60AX is a 32 bit, application class core supporting RV32IMCA and the [CORE-V eXtension Interface](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-xif) (CV-X-IF) and targeting TRL5 in 2024.

- [CV32A60X](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6) CV32A60X is a 32 bit embedded class core supporting RV32IMCA and CV-X-IF support, and targeting TRL5 in 2024.

- [CV32A65X](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva6) CV32A65X is a 32 bit embedded class core supporting RV32IMCA with CV-X-IF support and dual issue, and targeting TRL5 in 2024.

# CORE-V CVW Family, 5-Stage Cores

[CVW](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cvw) CORE-V Wally is a set of 32-bit and 64-bit RISC-V cores that implement RV32I, RV32E, and RV64I with a 5-stage pipeline, support for A, C, D, F, and M extensions, and optional caches, branch
prediction, virtual memory, AHB, RAMs, and peripherals. Wally is targeted at Education and will be accompanied by an engineering textbook and course on computer architecture.


# CORE-V CVE4 Family, 4-Stage Embedded Class Cores

CVE4 is a family of cores for embedded platforms that started from the PULP RI5CY core. These cores are 32bit, 4-stage in-order cores. Single configurations of these cores are maintained on different repositories and specialize in different embedded applications. Please find below the members of the CVE4 family.

- [CV32E40PV1 and CV32E40PV2](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40p) Originally known as the PULP RI5CY core, the CORE-V CV32E40P is a 32bit, 4-stage core that implements, RV32IMFC[Xpulp], has an optional 32-bit FPU supporting the F and Zfinx extensions and custom instruction set extensions for DSP operations, including hardware loops, SIMD extensions, bit manipulation and post-increment instructions.  Release 2 supports RV32IMC[F|Zfinx]ZicsrZifenceiZicntr[COREV_PULP][COREV_CLUSTER]. This repository is has been moved (not forked) from the original PULP Platform github repository to its new home at the OpenHW Group github repository.

- [CV32E40S](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40s) The CORE-V CV32E40S is a small and efficient, 32-bit, in-order RISC-V core with a 4-stage pipeline that implements the RV32[I|E][M|Zmmul]Zca_Zcb_Zcmp_Zcmt[Zba_Zbb_Zbs|Zba_Zbb_Zbc_Zbs]ZicsrZifenceiXsecure instruction set architecture. The CV32E40S core is aimed at security applications and offers both Machine mode and User mode, an enhanced PMP, and various anti-tampering features.

- [CV32E40X](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e40x) The CORE-V CV32E40X is a small and efficient, 32-bit, in-order RISC-V core with a 4-stage pipeline that implements the RV32[I,E][M|Zmmul][A]Zca_Zcb_Zcmp_Zcmt[Zba_Zbb_Zbs|Zba_Zbb_Zbc_Zbs]ZicntrZihpmZicsrZifencei[X] instruction set architecture. The CV32E40X core is aimed at compute intensive applications and offers a general purpose extension interface [CORE-V-XIF](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-xif) by which custom instructions can be added external to the core.

- [CV32E40PX] The CORE-V CV32E40PX adds RVB, RVP, and RVK support plus CV-X-IF support to the CV32E40PV2

- [CV32E41P](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cv32e41p) is a small and efficient, 32-bit, in-order RISC-V core with a 4-stage pipeline that implements the RV32IM[F,Zfinx]C[Zce] instruction set architecture, and the Xpulp custom extensions for achieving higher code density, performance, and energy efficiency. Starting as a fork of the CV32E40P core, the E41P then implemented the official RISC-V Zfinx and Zce ISA extensions.



# CORE-V Embedded Class, 2-Stage Core

[CVE2](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cve2) is a low-complexity, low-power, 32-bit, in-order RISC-V core with a 2-stage pipeline that implements RV32[E|I][M]C instruction set architecture for achieving high-energy efficiency on control-oriented, computationally limited applications. Starting as a fork of the lowRISC Ibex core, the CVE2 will be pared back to essential components and verified at industrial-grade.


# CORE-V CVA5 FPGA optimized core

[CVA5](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cva5) The CVA5 is a 32-bit RISC-V processor designed for FPGAs supporting the Multiply/Divide and Atomic extensions (RV32IMA). The processor is written in SystemVerilog and has been designed to be both highly extensible and highly configurable. The CVA5 is derived from the Taiga Project from Simon Fraser University. The pipeline has been designed to support parallel, variable-latency execution units and to readily support the inclusion of new execution units.
